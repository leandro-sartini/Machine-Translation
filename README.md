# Machine-Translation
Machine Translation test for Udacity NLP Course.

Here i developed 5 Sequential Models to translate english to french.

For the last part i used an Encoder with a Bidirectional RNN using Embedding and LSTM connected to a LSTM Decoder which generated results of 97% Accuracy.

For future trainings i will try providing the decoder with an Attention Layer, i couldn't provide that since Keras Version couldn't be upgraded on lab, and also a database with other sentences in other languages to make a universal translator.
